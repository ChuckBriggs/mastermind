# NOTE: "Cows" and "bulls" terminology comes from the game Cows & Bulls. Cows
#       are matches in incorrect positions, bulls are matches in their correct
#       possition. Having an assload of methods and variables with names like
#       "correct_color_incorrect_location_count" would have been tedious AF.
