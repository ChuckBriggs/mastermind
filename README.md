Mastermind assignment for The Odin Project
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/tic-tac-toe

NOTE: I used terminology from the game "Cows & Bulls" (which Mastermind is based
      on) in the code. Cows are matches in incorrect positions, bulls are
      matches in their correct possition. It seemed easier than having an
      assload of methods and variables with names like
      "correct_color_incorrect_location_count".
